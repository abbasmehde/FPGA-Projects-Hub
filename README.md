## 🔍 Binary Sequence Detector

This project is a **Binary Sequence Detector** that identifies a predefined binary pattern from a continuous input stream. Whenever the target sequence is detected, the output generates a high signal (`1`) to indicate successful detection. 🚦

The design is based on **Finite State Machine (FSM)** logic and operates in real-time, allowing it to detect the sequence multiple times by automatically resetting after each detection. This type of implementation is commonly used in digital systems for pattern recognition, signal processing, and communication protocols. ⚙️💡

### 🧠 Key Features:
- Real-time sequence detection
- FSM-based digital logic
- Multiple sequence detection support
- Simple and efficient design

> 💼 This project is ideal for students and engineers interested in digital design, Verilog/VHDL programming, or understanding how sequence detectors work in hardware systems.
